# coding-samples
This area contains coding projects done as part of my Albany Can Code training course.

To copy these files to your own machine, please carry out the following steps:

1) Click the green "Clone or download" button on the right side of the screen.
2) Click on "Download ZIP" option. On a Windows machine, this will usually save the ZIP file to the "Downloads" folder on your C-drive.
3) Make sure that you have a program to unZIP the file with. I use the free 7-Zip program.
4) Once the "coding-samples" repository/directory is unZIP-ped, click into each project folder and open the file named "index.html" in order to view that sample website.
